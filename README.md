# Horieson-Refactor 



I was tasked with refactoring the Horiseon website by adding semantic html and css elements. i commented every line that I could without cluttering the syntax and by putting comment labels on each line that represented either a whole section of the page or whe nit represented something imparticular.

What this application does is show the customer all of the services and benefits of using Horiseon as their partner in business and in development and production for their buisness.

I shortened some of the css and html syntax since it simplified the syntax by reducing the amount of syntax that the web browser has to read. Resulting in the website to be smaller in file size, improving the upload/download speed of the Horiseon website.

Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

There were some challenge I faced refactoring this website since the pages links and layout (syntax wise) wasn't organized well. It had a lot more clutter and unnecessary id's and classes and so much repetition of div in the html file and D.R.Y. habbits in the css file.
